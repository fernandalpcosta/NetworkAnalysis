#Learning objectives
In these exercises, we will use the **STRING**, **STITCH**, and **DISEASES** databases through their respective web interfaces. The exercises will teach you how to:

* retrieve a STRING network for a protein of interest
* interpret the different visual representations
* inspect the evidence behind an interaction
* retrieve a STITCH network for chemical compound of interest
* use DISEASES to find proteins associated with a disease of interest
