## Learning Objectives
In these exercises, we will use the stringApp for Cytoscape to retrieve molecular networks from the [STRING](https://string-db.org/) and [STITCH](http://stitch-db.org/) databases. The exercises will teach you how to:

* retrieve networks for proteins or small-molecule compounds of interest
* retrieve networks for a disease or an arbitrary topics in PubMed
* layout and visually style the resulting networks
* import external data and map them onto a network
* perform enrichment analyses and visualize the results
* merge and compare networks
* select proteins by attributes
* identify functional modules through network clustering
