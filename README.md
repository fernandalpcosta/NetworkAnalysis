# Network Analysis
Network analysis and visualization with Cytoscape and STRING

## Prerequisite
To follow the exercises, please make sure that you have the latest version of [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/download.html) installed. Then start **Cytoscape** and go to **Apps â†’ App Manager** to check for new apps, install them and update the current ones if necessarily. The exercises require you to have certain Cytoscape apps installed. Search for the **stringApp** in the search field; if it is not already installed, select it and press the Install button to install it. Similarly, make sure you have the **yFiles Layout Algorithms**, **enhancedGraphics**, and **clusterMaker2** apps installed before closing the App Manager.

## Learning Objectives
In these exercises, we will use the stringApp for Cytoscape to retrieve molecular networks from the [STRING](https://string-db.org/) and [STITCH](http://stitch-db.org/) databases. The exercises will teach you how to:

* retrieve networks for proteins or small-molecule compounds of interest
* retrieve networks for a disease or an arbitrary topics in PubMed
* layout and visually style the resulting networks
* import external data and map them onto a network
* perform enrichment analyses and visualize the results
* merge and compare networks
* select proteins by attributes
* identify functional modules through network clustering
